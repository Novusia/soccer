  <p>Nowadays, young people often do not remember about el phenomenon and when they hear about the words "Ronaldo" they think "CR7". And because I want introduce to you stars from my childhood. They were equally great players today if not better in certain aspects.
</p>
  <p>
      Of Course in earlier years existed a great footballers. Name like Maradona or Pele are the famous but not a lot of people saw how they played. From "old years" i can recommend also see players like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg0phFPws_Q">Romario</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OlVT18hG6c">Garrincha.</a>
  </p>

    <h2>Ronaldo</h2>
     <p>Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima born 18 September 1976, commonly known as Ronaldo who played as a striker. Popularly dubbed "El Fenômeno". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest football players of all time. Unfortunately he had two  serious injuries and end  great  career.</p>
<p>
As a striker he had awesome drybling, awesome speed (even having not being a thin player he was faster than "fit" players). During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, which was a World Cup record at the time.

    <h2>Ronaldinho</h2>
     <p> Ronaldo de Assis Moreira born 21 march 1980 in Porto Alegre. Played as a attacking midfield, left Wing or secondary striker. In one of the meetings of youth teams scored 23 goals, including 2 directly from corners</p>
<p>For me he was like freestyler podczas offical fotball game. A lot frestaler have a better skils then he in frestaler but on game pitch I never I have not seen better from him. Game skills + frestaler skills = football art.</p>

    <h2>Roberto Carlos</h2>
     <p>Roberto Carlos da Silva born 10 april 1973 in Garça –  football coach and footballer. Actually Indian trainer Delhi Dynamos.</p>

<p>He played on the defensive position. He was considered one of the best left defenders of the world. Effectively playing sliding, characterized by speed, agility, able to construct a very fast counter and most importantly hit very hard with the left foot. The record speed that he gave the ball was 179 km / h.
  </p>
        <p>I loved watching his defensive position change to "attacker".</p>
